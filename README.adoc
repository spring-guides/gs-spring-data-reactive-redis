This guide walks you through the process of creating a functional reactive application that uses Spring Data to interact with Redis using the non-blocking Lettuce driver.

== What you'll build

You'll build a Spring application that uses https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-redis/[Spring Data Redis] and https://projectreactor.io/[Project Reactor] to interact with a Redis data store reactively, storing and retrieving `Coffee` objects without blocking. This application uses Reactor's `Publisher` implementations based upon the Reactive Streams specification, namely `Mono` (for a Publisher returning 0 or 1 value) and `Flux` (for a Publisher returning 0 to n values).

== What you'll need

== Create a domain class

Create a class representing a type of coffee we wish to stock in our coffee catalog.

`src/main/java/hello/Coffee.java`
[source,java]
----

----

NOTE: I use Lombok in this example to eliminate the boilerplate code for constructors and so-called "data class" methods ( accessors/mutators, `equals()`, `toString()`, & `hashCode()`).


== Create a configuration class with Spring Beans supporting reactive Redis operations

`src/main/java/hello/CoffeeConfiguration.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/CoffeeConfiguration.java[]
----


== Create a Spring Bean to load some sample data to our application when we start it

NOTE: Since we may (re)start our application multiple times, we should first remove any data that may still exist from previous executions. We do this with a `flushAll()` (Redis) server command. Once we've flushed any existing data, we create a small `Flux`, map each coffee name to a `Coffee` object, and save it to the reactive Redis repository. We then query the repo for all values and display them.

== Create a RestController to provide an external interface for our application

`src/main/java/hello/CoffeeController.java`
[source,java]
----

== Make the application executable

Although it is possible to package this service as a traditional link:/understanding/WAR[WAR] file for deployment to an external application server, the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a standalone application. You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java `main()` method. Along the way, you use Spring's support for embedding the link:/understanding/Netty[Netty] asynchronous "container" as the HTTP runtime instead of deploying to an external instance.


`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]


== Test the application

Now that the application is running, you can test it by accessing `http://localhost:8080/coffees` from HTTPie, curl, or your favorite browser.


== Summary

Congratulations! You've just developed a Spring application that uses Spring Data and Redis for fully reactive, non-blocking database access!
